# tongue_scribbler
A repo for an app to learn non-latin writing systems: hindi, arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic.     
Currently in progress.   
Check out another app that allows Chinese and Japanese writing: [tongue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tongue-flashcards/id6464297462).

The algorithm is based on anon's anki deck: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/fhte8l/i_have_developed_write_chinese_for_anki/), which in turn sources character svgs and animations from [hanziwriter](https://hanziwriter.org/) project. Ported from javascript to Swift by me.   
I also used characters from [animCJK](https://github.com/parsimonhi/animCJK/tree/master) project.
